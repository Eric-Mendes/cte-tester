# CTETester
CTETester is a Python package that provides an easy way to test Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL queries. CTEs are a powerful feature of SQL that allow you to define named temporary result sets that can be referenced later in the same query. However, writing complex queries with CTEs can be error-prone, and it can be difficult to test them thoroughly.

CTETester solves this problem by allowing you to test your CTEs in a simple and straightforward way. Given a SQL query and a target CTE, CTETester returns a modified query that tests the target CTE. This modified query can be run against your database to ensure that your CTE is correct and that it returns the expected results.

CTETester is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with your existing Python code. It supports a wide range of SQL databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, and it can be used with any Python web framework, such as Django or Flask.

With CTETester, you can be confident that your CTEs are correct and that your SQL queries are working as intended.
